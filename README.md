# Number-Theory
A few fun algorithms from elementary number theory.

euclidean.py is the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Given two integers x1, x2, finds their greatest common divisor and BÃ©zout coefficients b1, b2 , i.e., x1b1 + x2b2 = 1.

farey.py finds the sorted Farey Sequence of order n, a given natural number (positive integer). A Farey sequence of order n is the sequence of completely reduced fractions, between 0 and 1, which when in lowest terms have denominators less than or equal to n, arranged in order of increasing size.

primecheck.py tests primality of a given integer n.

primefact.py is a greedy algorithm to find the prime factorization of a given integer n. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that any integer can be represented as a product of prime factors.

zeckendorf.py finds the Zeckendorf representation of a natural number, i.e., as a sum of Fibonacci numbers.
